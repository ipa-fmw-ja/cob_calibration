cob_calibration
===============

Calibrates cameras, arm and torso of Care-O-bot

Execution:
----------

bring up robot
	roslaunch cob_bringup robot.launch

start arm navigation
	roslaunch cob_arm_navigation start_planning_environment.launch

Calibrate Torso(WIP)

run data collection
	roslaunch cob_calibration_executive collect_robot_calibration_data.launch

calibrate_cameras(WIP)


restart robot(kill bringup then restart)

run robot_calibration
	roslaunch cob_robot_calibration run_robot_calibration.launch

???


Configure Calibration
----------

1. create a new confiruration folder in the package "cob_calibration_config"
    named after the robot.



2. create the file "user_defined/cameras.yaml"

define how many cameras are involved
for each camera define "topic";"frame_id"(from robot urdf), " property"( position in urdf)
"file_prefix" (for camera calibration)

3. calibration_seed.yaml: teach in on hardware(or simulation)

4. calibration_pattern:
in most cases copy the existing cb9x6 for robots at the ipa


5. generate template for optimization and autogenerated files
bringup robot (in simulation or on real robot)
"roslaunch cob_robot_calibration generate_config.launch"


6. generate calibration positions
with running ik services
"roslaunch cob_calibration_executive" 

7. create free_0.yaml --> free_2.yaml
for care-o-bot first step with free cb_arm transformation
 second step with cameras mount position added
third step with all unknown transformations


Runnuning Calibration

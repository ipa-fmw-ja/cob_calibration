cob_calibration
===============

Calibrates cameras, arm and torso of Care-O-bot



Configure Calibration
----------

1. create a new confiruration folder in the package "cob_calibration_config"
    named after the robot.



2. create the file "user_defined/cameras.yaml"

define how many cameras are involved
for each camera define "topic";"frame_id"(from robot urdf), " property"( position in urdf)
"file_prefix" (for camera calibration)

3. calibration_seed.yaml: teach in on hardware(or simulation)

4. calibration_pattern:
in most cases copy the existing cb9x6 for robots at the ipa


5. generate template for optimization and autogenerated files
bringup robot (in simulation or on real robot)
```shell roslaunch cob_robot_calibration generate_config.launch```


6. generate calibration positions
with running ik services
```shell roslaunch cob_calibration_executive``` 

7. create free_0.yaml --> free_2.yaml
for care-o-bot first step with free cb_arm transformation
 second step with cameras mount position added
third step with all unknown transformations


Running Calibration
----------

1. move to calibration position
```shell roslaunch cob_calibration_executive move_arm_to_calibration_position.launch```

mount calibration object(defined in step 4 of configuration) on arm

2. collect data
```shell roslaunch cob_calibration_executive collect_robot_calibration_data.launch ```
Robot moves to the sample positions calculated in step6 of configuration


3. calibrate cameras
```shell roslaunch cob_camera_calibration calibrate_stereo.launch```
for robotn with only one calibrated camera this step is not required

4. calibrate robot
```shell roslaunch cob_robot_calibration run_robot_calibration.launch```
calculation takes about 5 to 10 minutes

5. update urdf
```shell roslaunch cob_robot_calibration update_calibration_urdf.launch```
copies the result of the optimization to the robot urdf file
